# `nest`

Your windows always find their way home with `nest`.

`nest` is an automatic window switcher for [Hyprland]("https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland").
It learns where you like your apps to live and makes sure they always end up in the right workspace or monitor - no hunting, no dragging, no friction.

## Philosophy

`nest` follows a few simple principles:
- Always predictable - You should know where your apps will appear before you even open them.
- Never intrusive - Nest runs quietly in the background, without stealing focus or slowing you down.
- Learn, don’t force - It adapts to your habits instead of making you adapt to it.
- Built for speed - Lightweight, event-driven, and tuned for real workflows.

## Features

- Learns your habits - Nest remembers where you usually place apps.
- Workspace aware - Keep your browser on workspace 2, Discord on workspace 5, and terminal on workspace 1, automatically.
- Real-time - Reacts to new windows instantly via Hyprland’s IPC stream.
- Lightweight - Runs in the background without getting in your way.

## Getting Started

- Install `nest` (TODO: installation instructions).
- Run `nest` in the background (e.g., from your Hyprland config).
- Open your apps as usual - `nest` will do the rest.

## Roadmap

- Recency-weighted learning
- Configurable rules for fine-tuned control
- Export/import history
- Optional integration with app launchers
